IT 2045C Computer Programming II Prof. Tom Wulf Lab 09: Java Data Streams Spring 2022 20 pts
Explore the Java Data Stream Processing
IntelliJ Project name: DataStreams Create a Swing GUI that:
 Allows the user to load a text file using the JFileChooser
 Asks the user to enter a search string into a textField
 Uses java data stream processing to return the lines of the file that contain the search String. 
Specifically use the Stream, and filter with a lambda expression to do this.
GUI Notes:
 I’m leaving this to you for the most part.
 You should have two parallel scrolling textAreas. Display the original file on the left-hand side and the filtered file on the right-hand side
 Provide the textField for the search string
 Provide command buttons for
o Load a file
o Search the file (after a file is loaded only)
o Quit
Be sure to use the modern java file system classes Path and Files try (Stream lines = Files.lines(Paths.get(FILEPATH)))
DO NOT THROW THE IOEXCEPTION ON MAIN be sure to handle the errors with the usual try catch mechanism.. NO credit if you do this!
Provide screen shots which clearly show:
- A shot of your source code that shows that you used the Steam approach here.
- the JFileChooser selecting the file - clear side by side displays of the file and the filtered results for at least 3 sample files. 
- Use 3 different search strings, that is a different one for each example.
Submitting your Work:

code shots this file renamed LastnameFirstname _Lab_09.docx (using your actual name).
